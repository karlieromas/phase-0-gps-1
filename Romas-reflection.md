**What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**
  I was struggling with remembering to make different branches. A few times I needed to back track and make new branches and then move the files there. I was also struggling with merge conflicts a bit.
**What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**
  The concept of pushing and pulling from GitHub were clarified.
**What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**
  I asked about making new branches and where to push which branch (ie origin master or the feature branch)
**What still confuses you about Git?**
  I am still a bit weary on where to push branches, be it another feature branch name or always origin master?
**How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**
  It was really nice to work on a project together and have someone observe. I liked that if my partner and I didn't know how to do something or had a quick question, we could ask our guide and they could shed some light on the subject.
